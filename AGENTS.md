# AGENTS Instructions

These instructions apply to the entire repository.

- Keep the project framework-free and compatible with static hosting.
- Use two spaces for indentation in all HTML, JS, and JSON files.
- Avoid introducing build steps or package dependencies.
- Update `README.md` when user-visible features or configuration options change.
- When possible, run `npm test` to execute any available test scripts. It's OK if the command fails because no tests are defined.
- For pull request messages, include a brief summary of changes and list any manual or automated test results.
